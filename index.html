            <div class="left">
        <p><b><mark> Sheep (Ovis aries) are quadrupedal, ruminant mammals typically kept as livestock. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order
		Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates. Although the name "sheep" applies to many species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost 
		always refers to Ovis aries. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a ewe (/juː/), an intact male as a ram or occasionally a tup, a castrated male as a wether, and a younger sheep as a lamb.
          </b></mark>  </p><br>
		  <p><span style="color:red">Sheep</span> are most likely descended from the wild mouflon of Europe and Asia.<span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold"> One of the earliest animals to be domesticated
		  for agricultural purposes, sheep are raised for fleece, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and milk.</span> <span style="color:orange; font-style:italic">A sheep's wool is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by shearing. Ovine meat is called lamb when from younger animals and mutton when from older ones. Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for
		  pelts, as dairy animals, or as model organisms for science.</span>
